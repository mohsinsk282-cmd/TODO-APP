Phase I Todo: Basic CRUD Operations

Intent: Create a Python CLI application that manages a list of todo items in-memory.

User Stories:
- As a user, I can create a task with a title and description.
- As a user, I can view all tasks with an ID and status.
- As a user, I can update the title or description of an existing task.
- As a user, I can mark a task as complete.
- As a user, I can delete a task by its ID.

Success Criteria (SMART):
- Tasks are stored in a Python list or dictionary (In-Memory).
- Viewing the list shows clear indicators for 'Completed' vs 'Pending'.
- Updating/Deleting a non-existent ID results in a clear error message.
- The application follows the project Constitution standards.

Constraints:
- No data persistence (no JSON/DB).
- Strictly Python 3.13 CLI.
- Before writing the spec, create a new branch

Non-Goals:
- No web or graphical interface.
- No user authentication.
- No sorting or filtering (save for Phase II).
```

## Response snapshot

Created feature specification for Basic Todo CRUD Operations on branch `001-basic-crud`.

**Specification Structure**:
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P5) with independent test descriptions
- 18 detailed acceptance scenarios across all user stories
- 15 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015)
- 8 measurable success criteria (SC-001 to SC-008)
- 6 edge cases with documented assumptions
- Key entities, constraints, non-goals, and assumptions sections

**User Stories** (independently testable):
1. Create Todo Item (P1) - Foundation/MVP
2. View All Todo Items (P2) - Visibility
3. Mark Todo as Complete (P3) - Progress tracking
4. Update Todo Item (P4) - Edit functionality
5. Delete Todo Item (P5) - Cleanup

**Quality Validation**:
- All checklist items passed (100%)
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (informed assumptions documented)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation details in specification

Specification ready for `/sp.plan`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification created for Phase I Basic CRUD operations, providing clear requirements for 5 independently testable user stories
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (specification artifact)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-basic-crud/spec.md (181 lines) and specs/001-basic-crud/checklists/requirements.md (60 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create architecture and implementation plan based on this specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully translates user requirements into prioritized, testable user stories with clear acceptance criteria. All requirements are technology-agnostic and measurable. Assumptions documented for edge cases. Ready for architectural planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec Quality Checklist - PASS (all 14 validation criteria met)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial spec)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor `/sp.plan` to ensure architecture aligns with constitution principles (in-memory, no global variables, clean data structures)
